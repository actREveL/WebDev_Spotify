# Spotify Charts

> A set of all daily hit charts curated by Spotify from 2017 to 2021

We are four students at the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons studying Digital Business Management. We have built a UI for an existing data set. Not just for fun - altough a little bit - but this project was part of a class called Web Development: a mandatory class.
